ðŸ“˜ Harvard CS50x Coursework

This repository contains my completed coursework for [Harvard University's CS50x: Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), a rigorous and foundational course that dives into computer science principles using C, Python, SQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript.

ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/harvard-cs50x.git
     cd harvard-cs50x
  
2. Navigate to any problem set directory:

   bash
     cd pset1
     make mario
     ./mario
   

Ensure you have a C compiler (such as `gcc`), Python, and SQLite installed, depending on the problem set.
